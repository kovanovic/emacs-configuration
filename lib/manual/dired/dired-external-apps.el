;;; Commentary:

;;  In dired in GNU Emacs, the dired-do-shell-command feature (bound to "!" by
;;  default), is useful for running an external command on the current filename.

;;  This has a bad limitation, however: it doesn't really do
;;  asynchronous launches.  If you remember to append a & (and
;;  remember to include a place holder "*" for the filename) the
;;  command *will* run without hanging up emacs, but you'll find
;;  that it hangs up the "!" command: you won't be able to do
;;  another launch until the first finishes.

;;  (Note that xemacs is better off in this respect: it's dired
;;  has a feature bound to "&" to run fully asynchronous commands.)

;;  So this package addresses that limitation by creating
;;  a sub-shell buffer it uses internally to do application launches
;;  (by default, this is called "*external apps shell*").
;;  This has a few advantages over approaches that create a new shell
;;  for each invocation, not the least of which is that all output
;;  (error messages and so on) are automatically gathered together
;;  into this one buffer.

;;  There's another (lesser) limitation with the "!" command that's
;;  also addressed here: while it has a very good feature that
;;  guesses which command to run based on the file extension,
;;  this feature is less useful if there's no single clear best
;;  guess for a given file extension.

;;  Consider the case of an image extension like "JPG". Commonly,
;;  one might want to view, rotate or crop a jpeg, but each of these
;;  operations is best handled by a different program.  So the
;;  single guess of the "!" command isn't enough: it's better to
;;  have seperate keystroke commands in dired to run the specific
;;  image applications.

;;  There's an additional feature that can be useful (though it's
;;  shut-off by default to minimize obnoxiousness): running a
;;  command on a file can automatically save information about the
;;  file to the kill-ring and to user registers (by default, "n"
;;  for the name and "p" for the path).  This facilitates doing
;;  moves or renames in dired; writing notes about the files; or
;;  running other commands on them manually in a sub-shell window.

;;  Further documentation is included in the doc strings
;;  for the dummy variables dired-external-apps-documentation-*

;; =======
;; user documentation

(defvar dired-external-apps-documentation t
"Documentation for the dired-external-apps package.
This package provides functions to do multiple asynchronous
launches of external applications, and to simplify launching
applications from dired, particularly in the case where there's
no single association between an application and a file extension.

Synopsis of usage:

Put the file dired-external-apps.el in one of your load-path locations,
and add the following to your ~/.emacs:

   (require 'dired-external-apps)

Add any applications/wrapper scripts you might want to use from dired
that aren't already included:

  (setq dired-external-apps-list (cons \"xw3m\" dired-external-apps-list ))
  (setq dired-external-apps-list (cons \"xlynx\" dired-external-apps-list ))
  (dired-external-apps-generate-wrapper-functions-for-apps) ;; reinitialize after changes

To enable the side-effect of saving file information:

  (setq dired-external-apps-save-to-registers-flag t)

Most likely you will also want to add some keybindings,
for example:

  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook
    '(lambda ()
     (define-key dired-mode-map
       \"o\"
       'dired-external-apps-open-with-gthumb)
     (define-key dired-mode-map
       [return]
       'dired-external-apps-open-with-emacs) ; i.e. inside of emacs in image-mode
     (define-key dired-mode-map
       \"\\C-o\"
       'dired-external-apps-open-with-gthumb)
     (define-key dired-mode-map
       \"\\-\"
       'dired-external-apps-open-with-gimp)
     ))

A brief tutorial:

With the above suggested set-up, working in dired with image
files can be simplified.  Typically, one might want to view,
rotate or crop a jpeg, but each of these operations is probably
best handled by a different program.  Hitting the \"o\" key will
launch gthumb opening the current file, hitting the \"-\" will
launch gimp, and if you hit RETURN the image will be opened
inside of emacs in an image-mode buffer.

\(Note: for improvements in working with image-mode, see the
related package image-mode-dired.el\)

As a side-effect, opening a file with one of these commands also
places the file information in some user registers, and on to the
kill-ring (though only if \\[dired-external-apps-save-to-registers-flag]
has been set).  The register \"n\" will have the file name, the
register \"p\" will have the path to the file, and the kill-ring
will have the file name (sans path) pushed on to it.

This greatly simplifies doing other operations on the file after
viewing the image: for example, if you rename it with \\[dired-do-rename]
(bound by default to \"R\"), you can begin by yanking the current
file name (C-y) to have a starting point to edit.  Other uses
include manual operations in a shell, emailing the file name, or
just making notes about it.  For hints about using emacs registers
with this package see \\[dired-external-apps-documentation-appendix-registers].

All of these external application launches are done in a special
sub-shell named: \{dired-external-apps-shell-buffer}, so if there
seems to be a problem with them, you should look in that buffer
for any relevant error messages.

For additional information on this package, see:
\\[dired-external-apps-documentation-appendix-misc].")

(defvar dired-external-apps-documentation-appendix-registers t
  "Emacs has a series of \"registers\" with single-character
names available for use, primarily by the user.  As a
convenience, some routines here places some information in these
registers for later use (though only if
\\[dired-external-apps-save-to-registers-flag] has been set).
The path of the last file accessed goes in register \"p\", and
the file name goes in \"n\".

By default, the register commands all use the same \"C-x r\"
prefix.  To insert the contents of register \"p\", you would do a
\"C-x r i p\".  You can simplify that operation by re-binding
this to the otherwise underused \"insert\" key with this in your
.emacs file:

   (global-set-key [insert] 'insert-register)

If you dislike the choices of registers \"p\" and \"n\", you can
change them by modifying \\[dired-external-apps-path-register]
and/or \\[dired-external-apps-name-register].  For example, to use
uppercase \"P\" instead of \"p\", add this to your .emacs file:

   (setq dired-external-apps-path-register ?P)

See the emacs manual for more information on using registers:
section 18 on \"Registers\".")
